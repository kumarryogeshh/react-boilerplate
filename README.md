# react-boilerplate
This React JS boilterplate code designed using webpack. Although the React starter repo, [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) makes it faster to setup, you can use this code if you want to learn what webpack does behind-the-scence.

## Getting Started

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/kumarryogeshh/react-boilerplate.git

$ npm start
```
